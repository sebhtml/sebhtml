# Hello World

- :wave: My name is `sebhtml`.
- :wrench: I am a software engineering professional ("Software Developer").
- :spider_web: I initially specialized in following hyper-link (hence the "html" part in "sebhtml").
- :crab: I now specialize in software engineering using Rust.
- :robot: I like to learn about AI and other things using AI and prompt engineering (as an LLM end user).
- :penguin: I use Linux, namely Ubuntu.
- :t-rex: I used to like C++. Now I don't because, in the std lib, class names use snake case and because it's super silly, for the same class, to write code in .h files and in .cpp files.
- :computer: I like to learn about hardware. But it's not my specialty and others do it better than me.
- :steam_locomotive: I build and deploy with Cargo, Docker, GitLab CI, Google Cloud, AWS. But cloud engineering is not my specialty, and others do it better than me.
- :muscle: I do powerlifting and calisthenics in my spare time.
- :potted_plant: I have a few plants.
