- :wave: My name- is `sebhtml`.
- :wrench: I am a software engineering professional ("Software Developer").
- :spider_web: I initially specialized in following hyper-link (hence the "html" part in "sebhtml").
- :crab: I now specialize in software engineering using Rust.
- :robot: I like to learn about AI and other things using AI and prompt engineering (as an LLM end user).
- :penguin: I use Linux, namely Ubuntu.
- :t-rex: I used to like C++. Now I don't because class name are in snake case in the std lib and because it's silly to write code in .h files in .cpp files for the same class.
- :computer: I like to learn about hardware, but it's not my specialty and others do it better than me.
- :steam_locomotive: I build and deploy with Cargo, Docker, GitLab CI, Google Cloud, AWS. (but cloud engineering is not my specialty)
